# LING571

This is the most fun assignment in this class I have done so far. I started clueless about
what to do, but it got easier as I tried to tackle the easiest sentences (about dogs barking)
and expanding the grammar to include/exclude sentences. For example, to include "reached the
summit on Tuesday" but not "reached the summit for five minutes", I introduced the "SEM"
feature on PPs, its child NPs and the verbs to limit what kind of PP can complement a certain
verb.

I am still not confident if I have handled all the "GAP" features reasonably, but this grammar
seems to have captured exactly the grammatical sentences in the test file. Another thing that I
am not quite sure about is handling optional PPs: what's the best way to tell apart optional PPs
and constrained PPs (for example only instants not durations)?
