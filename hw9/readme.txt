# LING571 HW9

This assignment doesn't include many design decisions, and is quite straightforward.
I learned how to use pretrained word embeddings to perform shallow discourse parsing
(as a multiclass classification task). The method specified by this homework is quite
naive (a BoW model) but not too bad with a simple logistic regression classifier.
Perhaps more modern models like LSTMs and transformer-based models will give much
better performance.
