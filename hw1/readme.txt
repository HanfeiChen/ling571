# LING571 HW1

This assignment was quite straightforward. It took me some time
to get the Python environment set up, but the assignment itself
was basically looking up the documentation of NLTK.

I learned to use NLTK to do basic CFG parsing. By looking at the
docs, I also learned about different components of the NLTK
library.
